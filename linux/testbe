# Script to run Bibledit-Desktop, but prepare to compare files before
# and after the run.

# 1. Store the old version of the files. Maybe do this just once...
#rm -rf ~/KJVdata
#mkdir ~/KJVdata
#cp -r ~/.bibledit/projects/KJV/data/* ~/KJVdata

# 2. Run Bibledit-Desktop. The user will load some USFM and store it.
../bin/bibledit-desktop --debug

# 3. We will compare the project files now to what they were before.
diff -r ~/KJVdata/ ~/.bibledit/projects/KJV/data
